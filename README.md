  Know me broken by my master<br></br>
Teach thee on child, love hereafter<br></br>
Into the flood again<br></br>
Same old trip it was back then<br></br>
So I made a big mistake<br></br>
Try to see it once my way<br></br>
Drifting body, it's sole desertion<br></br>
Flying, not yet quite the notion<br></br>
Into the flood again<br></br>
Same old trip it was back then<br></br>
So I made a big mistake<br></br>
Try to see it once my way<br></br>
Into the flood again<br></br>
Same old trip it was back then<br></br>
So I made a big mistake<br></br>
Try to see it once my way<br></br>
Am I wrong?<br></br>
Have I run too far to get home?<br></br>
Have I gone?<br></br>
Left you here alone<br></br>
Am I wrong?<br></br>
Have I run too far to get home? Yeah<br></br>
Have I gone?<br></br>
Left you here alone<br></br>
If I <b>would</b>, could you?<br></br>
